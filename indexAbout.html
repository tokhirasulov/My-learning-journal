                    <h1>Hi there! My name is Tokhir and welcome to my learning journal.</h1>
                    <p>After several months of learning in the Frontend 
                    Developer Career Path, I've made the big jump over to 
                    the Bootcamp to get expert code reviews of my Solo 
                    Projects projects and meet like-minded peers.</p>

            <h3>How I stay committed to learning</h3>
            <p>I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. 
            I used to spend hours and hours learning, then try to create 
            simple projects using what I learned or work new techniques 
            into existing projects.</p>
            <p>While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to 
            share what I was learning and most things about my journey 
            with the world.</p>
            <h3>How I got started</h3>
            <p>I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal 
            site. I would take notes about what I was learning. After 
            each learning session, I'd use my notes to not only reflect 
            on what I learned but also write short summaries of what I 
            learned using my own words.</p>
            <p>That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized 
            that posting my learning summaries was also helping others 
            learn and stay motivated.</p>
